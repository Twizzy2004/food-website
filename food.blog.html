		<h2>10 Foods That Help You Build Lean Muscle</h2>
		<p class="paragraph">Eggs</p>
		<p>Eggs contain high-quality protein, healthy fats and other important nutrients like B vitamins and choline.Proteins are made up of amino acids, and eggs contain large amounts of the amino acid leucine, which is particularly important for muscle gain.Also, B vitamins are critically important for a variety of processes in your body, including energy production</p>

		<p class="paragraph">Chicken Breast</p>
		<p>There’s a good reason why chicken breasts are considered a staple for gaining muscle.They are packed with protein, with each 3-ounce (85-gram) serving containing about 26 grams of high-quality protein.They also contain generous amounts of the B vitamins niacin and B6, which may be particularly important if you are active.These vitamins help your body function properly during the physical activity and exercise that’s necessary for optimal muscle gain.What’s more, some research has shown that higher-protein diets containing chicken may aid fat loss.</p>

		<p class="paragraph">Greek Yogurt</p>
		<p>Dairy not only contains high-quality protein, but also a mixture of fast-digesting whey protein and slow-digesting casein protein.Some research has shown that people experience increases in lean mass when they consume a combination of fast- and slow-digesting dairy proteins.However, not all dairy is created equal.For example, Greek yogurt often contains approximately double the amount of protein as regular yogurt.While Greek yogurt is a good snack anytime, eating it after a workout or before bed may be beneficial due to its mixture of fast- and slow-digesting proteins.</p>

		<p class="paragraph">Tuna</p>
		<p>In addition to 20 grams of protein per 3-ounce (85-gram) serving, tuna contains high amounts of vitamin A and several B vitamins, including B12, niacin and B6. These nutrients are important for optimal health, energy and exercise performance.Additionally, tuna provides large amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, which may support muscle health.This may be particularly important for older adults. Research has shown that omega-3 fatty acids can slow the loss of muscle mass and strength that occurs with age.</p>

		<p class="paragraph">Lean Beef</p>
		<p>Beef is packed with high-quality protein, B vitamins, minerals and creatine.Some research has even shown that consuming lean red meat can increase the amount of lean mass gained with weight training.However, even when you’re trying to gain muscle, it may be best to choose beef that supports muscle gain without providing too many extra calories.For example, 3 ounces (85 grams) of 70% lean ground beef contains 228 calories and a whopping 15 grams of fat.However, the same amount of 95% lean ground beef contains slightly more protein and only 145 calories and 5 grams of fat.</p>

       <p class="paragraph">Milk</p>
       <p>Milk provides a mix of protein, carbohydrates and fats.Similar to other dairy products, milk contains both fast- and slow-digesting proteins.This is thought to be beneficial for muscle growth. In fact, several studies have shown that people can increase their muscle mass when they drink milk in combination with weight training.</p>
	

       <p class="paragraph">Whey Protein</p>
       <p>There is a reason why whey protein supplements are the most popular supplement in the fitness industry: they provide a fast and convenient source of protein at an affordable price. Bodybuilders normally use them when they wake up, right after their workout, and mixed with some of their meals.For the rest of us, a scoop in our shakers right after our workouts can be very effective for muscle mass gains. It’s important that you still get high-quality protein from whole foods, and use whey protein as a boost.</p>

       <p class="paragraph">Oatmeal</p>
       <p>Oatmeal is a great source of carbohydrates due to both its low glycemic index (GI) value and the fact it is minimally processed. The benefits of a low-GI diet include:
       	Better micronutrient profile and more fiber
       	Increased satiety
       	Decreased hunger
       	Lower subsequent energy intake (second meal effect)
       	Fat loss
       	In short, low-GI foods can enhance fat loss for those looking to lose weight, and provide a constant source of carbs for muscle preservation.</p>

       <p class="paragraph">Fruits and Vegetables</p>
       <p>Fruits and vegetables are a rich source of antioxidants, which are essential for the healthy functioning of your immune system.They also provide tons of other nutrients, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene. Finally, your body requires the fiber these fruits and vegetables provide to aid in proper digestion and nutrient uptake.</p>

       <p class="paragraph">Soybeans</p>
       <p>Half a cup (86 grams) of cooked soybeans contains 14 grams of protein, healthy unsaturated fats and several vitamins and minerals.Soybeans are a particularly good source of vitamin K, iron and phosphorus.Iron is used to store and transport oxygen in your blood and muscles, and a deficiency can impair these functions.Young women may be particularly at risk of iron deficiency due to blood loss during menstruation.</p>
