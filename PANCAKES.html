		<h2>EASY AND HEALTHY BANANA OAT PANCAKES</h2>
		<p class="paragraph">Easy, healthy banana oat pancakes is a healthy, filling breakfast served with fresh fruit and can be made in minutes.</p>
		<p>Finding healthy, easy and satisfying breakfasts are always a mission for me. I am a big fan of eggs for breakfast but I get tired of it and so I often look for other ideas, but the other ideas aren’t exactly healthy. Pancakes, French Toast, waffles, Eggs Benedict…Not really ideal. So when I stumbled upon this easy healthy banana oat pancakes recipe, I was incredibly chuffed. They take minutes to knock together and they’re actually delicious.

		I am not usually a fan of flourless, sugar free “healthy pancakes”. I tried making a ground almond version a while ago and was left with what tasted like a gritty egg patty. Not my idea of pleasant.</p>
